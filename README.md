Jack Gordon's 2015 Edison Elementary Science Fair Project

##Me: What question do you want to answer for the science fair this year?
##Jack: What's the best sort of renewable energy for Denver, wind or solar?

After a school field trip to NREL in Golden, CO, and during his classroom module on energy, Jack has become very interested in renewable energy.  When it came time to choose a science fair project for this year, Jack envisioned an experiment that would help test whether solar or wind power produced more usable electricity for our location in Denver.

##Experimental Setup
For the experimental setup, we opted to build a homemade wind turbine and buy a Goal Zero solar panel off eBay.  The wind turbine consists of a 3-d printed darrieus VAWT turning a nema-17 stepper motor as an alternator via a 3:1 reduction gear.  The solar panel was hacked to bypass the USB charging circuitry and directly connect to the power coming off the panel.  To provide a more direct comparison between the DC power produced by the panel and the AC power produced by the turbine, the turbine alernator's phases were fed through a bridge rectifier (that Dad designed and Jack built,) and a smoothing capacitor to provide DC output.
For data logging and reporting, we selected a Particle Photon microcontroller due to ease of programming and ease of integration with web services for data logging & analysis.  DC power is fed independently from the solar panel and the turbine's rectifier to a voltage splitter consisting of a 470ohm and 220ohm resistor; this accounts for the 3.3v limit on the Photon's analog pins.  Our voltage divider reduces the input voltage according the the following equation:
##Vout = R2/R1+R2 * Vin, or 220/470+220 * Vin
What we're really interested in, however is the power generated by each of the two generation systems.  To satsify Watt's law (P=V*I) we need to know the current in the system.  Fortunately, Ohm's Law:
##I=V/R
tells us that our voltage divider represents a known resistive load from which we can calculate current, given a measured voltage:
##I=V/(220+470)
That about sums up the circuit design of the whole contraption, at least the relevant parts.  There are also lots of jumpers, breadboards and a voltage regulator involved to power the Photon.
##Logical Design
In the Photon firmware, we're reading voltage from the A0 and A1 pins, applying the appropriate calculations, and storing variables for voltage, current and power from each of the two systems.  Once each second, we're reading those pins and then writing the values to an Azure Event Hub via a Particle webhook.  Azure Table Storage is used for the storage of the logged data, and PowerQuery/PowerView are being used in Excel to visualize the data.
